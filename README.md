# Goal
To determine whether the physical and mental attributes of a person can determine whether or not that person has ever done 'hard' drugs before.

# Data Exploration
  Explore the data
# Models
  I ran Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost models and compared the accuracy and f1 scores to determine the best model to use.
  
# Conclusion
  The models can determine whether or not an individual has ever done a 'hard' drug in the past with eighty percent accuracy.
  
# Drawbacks
  The dataset is not comprehensive enough to support any major conclusions.
